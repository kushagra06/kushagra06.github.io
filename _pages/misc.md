* As a kid and teenager, I enjoyed playing badminton. I represented my state Rajasthan in the under-14 age group category at the national championship held in Pune, India. [Here's](http://kushagra06.github.io/images/badminton.jpeg) a blurry picture.

* I tried learning Tabla for some time as an early teen. I learned it for a couple of years but never became very good at it. Although, I played it from time to time. [Here's](http://kushagra06.github.io/images/tabla.jpg) a picture from college days. I also [tried](http://kushagra06.github.io/images/guitar.png) my hands at guitar. Didn't do particularly well with that either.

* During university days, I was involved in Asha Kiran for a while. It's a school run by IIIT students for kids from nearby slums. (Asha Kiran translates to *A ray of hope*). I taught science and math to middle school kids and realized I enjoy teaching and later became a TA for various university courses as well.

* Some of my most memorable and rewarding experiences have been during my internships at Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel and Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology in Okinawa, Japan. Apart from learning to do research and doing research, I got to meet some very talented people from all over the world and make new friends. [Here's](http://kushagra06.github.io/images/oist.jpeg) a picture from OIST and [here's](http://kushagra06.github.io/images/wis.jpg) one from WIS.
